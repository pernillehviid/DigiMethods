    "\n",
    "1. To get an even better sense of what your accounts tweet about than just using hashtags, you could count the most used words. Create a list that, for each account has a dictionary of the frequency of each word with stop words removed. Remember, you can reuse your code from W3D1. You can get a list of stop words from [here](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words). These are also stored in `stop_words.txt`. Add a column to your dataframe for most used words. \n",
    "2. Extract the number of favorites and retweets from the timelines you gathered. Is there any relationship between the number of followers and these figures? How about between these figures and the number of friends?\n",
    "3. Researchers often use Twitter because we can do respondent-driven sampling, i.e. we start with a few accounts and then collect the accounts that follow these accounts to get a broader picture of the network. Start exploring the networks of the accounts you collected using the [`followers`](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#API.followers) command.\n",
    "4. Given that the accounts you collected are similar in that they tweet about your topic of choice, it might be interesting know if there are issues that distinguish the accounts. Researchers often use term frequency-inverse document frequency to study such differences. [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-process-textual-data-using-tf-idf-in-python-cd2bbc0a94a3/) is a primer on the concept and a tutorial on how to implement it in Python.
